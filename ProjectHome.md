A home screen widget made as a workaround of Android 1.5 [Issue 2534](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2534).

version 1.3
  * fixes the "under heavy load" freezes

version 1.2
  * fixes a "phantom widget" remaining after delete or package upgrade
  * new icon

Known issues:
  * widgets stop working after package upgrade - delete and re-create the widgets or restart the phone after the upgrade
